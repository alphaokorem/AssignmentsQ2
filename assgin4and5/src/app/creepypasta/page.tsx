          It was just a game, they said. Something fun to play with friends
          online.
        </p>

        <p>
          We were a small group—five of us in total, meeting every Friday night
          to play the latest horror games. That evening, it was something new,
          something none of us had ever heard of. The game had no real title,
          just a strange file that had circulated around obscure forums. We
          thought it was perfect.
        </p>

        <p>
          When I logged in, there was nothing particularly unusual about it at
          first—just a creepy atmosphere, low ambient sounds, flickering lights,
          the usual tricks. But then, strange things started happening. At
          first, it was subtle. The whispers came, not from the game's audio but
          through my headset, barely audible, like voices just out of reach,
          murmuring in a language I couldn't quite grasp.
        </p>

        <p>But after I logged off, the whispers followed me.</p>

        <p>
          I could hear them—faint at first, like an echo inside my head—but they
          grew louder as the night went on. I thought maybe it was just the
          aftereffect of spending too long staring at the screen, my mind
          playing tricks on me. But as I sat there in my darkened room, I
          realized these weren't just sounds from the game. They were too real,
          too close.
        </p>

        <p>
          I turned around, scanning the room. Nothing. Just the soft glow of my
          computer monitor casting eerie shadows on the walls.
        </p>

        <p>That's when I noticed it.</p>

        <p>My reflection in the screen began to change.</p>

        <p>
          At first, I thought it was a trick of the light—maybe the residual
          graphics of the game still burning into my eyes. But it wasn't that.
          The reflection wasn't me anymore, not exactly. The eyes were darker,
          hollowed out like something inhuman stared back. Its face was twisted,
          a grotesque parody of my own features, as though the monitor itself
          had become a mirror to something else, something that wasn't supposed
          to exist.
        </p>

        <p>
          I froze, my breath caught in my throat, feeling the cold crawl up my
          spine.
        </p>

        <p>Staring back at me.</p>

        <p>
          My own reflection blinked, but I didn't. It smiled, but I hadn't moved
          a muscle.
        </p>

        <p>
          Panicking, I reached for the power button on the monitor, my fingers
          trembling, and pressed it.
        </p>

        <p> The reflection didn't leave.</p>

        <p>
          The screen was off, the room plunged into darkness. Yet, I could still
          see it—my reflection—clear as day, staring from the black surface of
          the monitor. The whispers grew louder, circling me, as if they were
          coming from the very walls of the room. I turned around, my heart
          pounding in my chest.
        </p>

        <p>I wasn't alone anymore.</p>

        <p>
          There was movement in the corner of my vision. Shapes, shadows that
          slithered along the edges of my room, creeping closer. The whispers
          became voices, distinct now, calling my name, telling me things I
          couldn't understand but knew weren't meant for me to hear. The
          reflection... no, the thing that had become my reflection... it was
          closer now, pressing its face against the glass of the screen, its
          eyes wide and unblinking.
        </p>

        <p>
          I backed away from the desk, trying to get as far away as possible,
          but the thing in the screen... it followed me. I could hear it,
          moving, crawling through the monitor, through the darkness itself. The
          shadows in my room thickened, swallowing the light, until there was
          nothing but its cold presence, filling every corner, every breath.
        </p>

        <p>I ran.</p>

        <p>
          Down the hall, past every door in my house that now seemed so
          unfamiliar, so wrong. But the further I ran, the more it felt like
          something was following, like the walls themselves were closing in. I
          could feel it behind me—the reflection, or whatever it had become, was
          no longer confined to the screen. It was in the room with me now,
          chasing me through the darkness.
        </p>

        <p>
          I stumbled into the living room, my hands fumbling for the light
          switch. When I finally found it, I flicked it on. The room lit up in a
          harsh, blinding glow. But the light brought no comfort. In the
          reflection of every window, every dark surface, it was there.
          Watching. Smiling. Waiting.
        </p>

        <p>The whispers... they wouldn't stop. They wouldn't leave.</p>

        <p>And neither would it.</p>
